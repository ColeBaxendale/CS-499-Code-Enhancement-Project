 * Description:
 * This service provides methods for interacting with user-related data from an API.
 * It includes methods for user registration, login, and other user-related operations.
 * 
 * Algorithm Strategy:
 * 1. Implement methods to interact with user-related endpoints of the API.
 * 2. Utilize Angular's HttpClient module to make HTTP requests to the API.
 * 3. Validate input parameters before making API requests to ensure data integrity.
 * 4. Handle errors and edge cases gracefully to provide a smooth user experience.
 * 
 * Params:
 * - Injectable: Injectable - Angular decorator to mark the service as injectable.
 * - HttpClient: HttpClient - Angular HTTP client for making requests to the server.
 * - Observable: Observable - RxJS observable for handling asynchronous data streams.
