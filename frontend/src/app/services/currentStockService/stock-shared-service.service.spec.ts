 * Test Suite: StockSharedServiceService

 * Filename: stock-shared-service.service.spec.ts

 * Created on: [February 2024]
 * Version: 1.0
 * 
 * Description: 
 * This file contains the test suite for the StockSharedServiceService. It aims to ensure the integrity and functionality
 * of the StockSharedServiceService, verifying that the service is properly instantiated and behaves as expected within
 * the application. This suite focuses on testing the foundational capabilities of the service, such as its ability to
 * be created and to manage stock details data effectively.
 * 
 * Test Strategy:
 * - Initialization test to verify that the service can be successfully created and injected.
 * - (Further tests could be designed to assess the functionality of methods like updateCurrentStockDetails and
 *    clearCurrentStockDetails, ensuring they correctly manipulate the BehaviorSubject and notify subscribers.)
