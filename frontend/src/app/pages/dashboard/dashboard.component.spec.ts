/**
 * Dashboard Component
 * 
 * Filename: dashboard.component.ts
 * Author: [Cole Baxendale]
 * Contact: [thecodercole@gmail.com]
 * Created on: [February 2024]
 * Version: 1.0
 * 
 * Description: 
 * This component represents the main dashboard of the application. It displays various
 * metrics, charts, and information relevant to the user's portfolio and stock data. 
 * The component is responsible for fetching and presenting data in an organized and 
 * user-friendly manner, providing an overview of the user's financial status.
 * 
 * Algorithm Strategy:
 * 1. Initialize the component and its properties, including data to be displayed.
 * 2. Implement methods to fetch and update dashboard data, such as portfolio summary and stock information.
 * 3. Utilize Angular's lifecycle hooks to handle component initialization, data fetching, and cleanup.
 * 4. Ensure error handling and graceful degradation of functionality in case of data retrieval failures.
